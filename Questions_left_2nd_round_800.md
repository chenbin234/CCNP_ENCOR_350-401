| Q717 API                            | Westbound—Integration APIs Cisco DNA Center platform can power end-to-end IT processes across the value chain by integrating various domains such as ITSM, IPAM, and reporting. By leveraging the REST-based Integration Adapter APIs, bi-directional interfaces can be built to allow the exchange of contextual information between Cisco DNA Center and the external, third-party IT systems. The westbound APIs provide the capability to publish the network data, events and notifications to the external systems and consume information in Cisco DNA Center from the connected systems. |

| Q702 VM                             | - Most commonly, an OVF file is used to describe a single virtual machine or virtual appliance. It can contain information about the format of a virtual disk image file as well as a description of the virtual hardware that should be emulated to run the OS or application contained on such a disk image.<br />- An OVA is an OVF file packaged together with all of its supporting files (disk images, etc.). You can read about the requirements for a valid OVA package in the OVF specification. Oftentimes people will say “an OVF” and really mean “an OVA.” |
