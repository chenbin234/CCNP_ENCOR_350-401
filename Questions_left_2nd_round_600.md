| Q582 BGP                   | BGP rib failure from ‘show ip bgp’ indicates that a route learned from a neighbor where a lower administrative distance (from a static, or other IGP) has already been installed into the routing table, thus the BGP route has failed to install into the IP routing table (RIB) because it has been trumped by the lower admin distance route. |

| Q526 SD-WAN                | Overlay Management Protocol (OMP): The OMP routing protocol has a similar structure to BGP and manages the SD-WAN overlay network. Its protocol runs between vSmart controllers and between vSmart controllers and WAN edge routers, where control plane information—such as route prefixes, next-hop routes, crypto keys, and policy information—is exchanged over a secure DTLS or TLS connection. |
